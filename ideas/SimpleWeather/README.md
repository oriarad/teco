# SimpleWeather
The idea is to create a package which allow to get meteorological data (i.e. temperature, wind, humidity etc.) - and provide the students some task regarding the weather.

# Examples for students' tasks
* Check what day in the past month was the coldest
* Search the highest speed of wind, print the date, time and location it was measured
